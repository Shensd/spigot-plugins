### How do I add them to my server?

These plugins have all been created using [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/), and can be built and exported using the built in tools. More in-depth build instructions will be added in the future as for the time being most of the commands are not in a server ready condition (save for HoneyBeeFacts).

### Which plugin is the best one?

HoneyBeeFacts.
